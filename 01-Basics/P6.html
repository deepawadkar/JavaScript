        1. arithematic operators => addition+, subtraction-,multiplication*,division/, modulous%, increment++, decrement--

        2. comparision (relational) operators => is equal to ==, identical(equal and of same type) ===, not equal to !=, not identical!==,greater than>,
        Greater equal to >=,less than <, less than or equal to <=

        3. bitwise operators => bitwise AND &, bitwise OR |, bitwise XOR ^, bitwise NOT~, bitwise left shift <<.
        bitwise right shift >>, bitwise right shift with zero >>>

        4. logical operators => logical AND &&, logical OR ||, logical NOT !

        5. assignment operators = assign =, add and asign +=, subtract and assign-=, multiply and assign*=, divide and assign/= , modulous and assign%=

        6. special and ternary operators => condition ? "true":"false";
